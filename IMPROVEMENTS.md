   Save and display high scores between game sessions. This could involve writing scores to a file and reading them when the game starts.

2. **Add different types of rocks:**
   Introduce various rock types with different behaviors, such as faster falling speeds or zigzag patterns.

3. **Implement power-ups:**
   Add occasional power-ups that provide temporary benefits (e.g., invincibility, slower rocks, or score multipliers).

4. **Create a config file:**
   Move game constants (e.g., screen dimensions, rock spawn rate, scoring parameters) to a separate configuration file for easy tweaking.

5. **Add sound effects:**
   Implement basic sound effects for actions like moving Rockman, rocks falling, or collecting power-ups.

6. **Enhance the visual experience:**
   Improve the ASCII graphics with more detailed representations of Rockman and rocks, or add simple animations.

7. **Implement levels:**
   Create distinct levels with increasing difficulty and unique challenges.

8. **Add a tutorial mode:**
   Implement a brief tutorial that explains the controls and scoring system to new players.

9. **Optimize rock management:**
   Use a more efficient data structure (e.g., spatial partitioning) for managing rocks, especially as their number increases.

10. **Implement proper game state management:**
    Create different game states (e.g., menu, playing, game over) for better flow control and to allow for features like a main menu.

11. **Add unit tests:**
    Implement unit tests for core game logic to ensure reliability and ease future modifications.

12. **Implement difficulty settings:**
    Allow players to choose different difficulty levels at the start of the game.

13. **Add achievements:**
    Implement an achievement system to give players additional goals and increase replayability.

14. **Optimize performance:**
    Profile the game and optimize any performance bottlenecks, especially for longer play sessions.

15. **Implement a replay system:**
    Add the ability to save and watch replays of gameplay sessions.

16. **Create a leaderboard:**
    Implement an online leaderboard system to allow players to compete globally.

17. **Add localization support:**
    Implement support for multiple languages to make the game accessible to a wider audience.

18. **Enhance logging and error handling:**
    Improve the current logging system and add more robust error handling to make debugging easier.

19. **Implement cheat codes:**
    Add secret cheat codes for fun additional features or to assist in testing.

20. **Create a level editor:**
    Develop a simple level editor to allow users to create and share custom levels.

These improvements build upon the existing features and aim to enhance the gameplay experience, add depth to the game, and improve its overall quality and maintainability.
