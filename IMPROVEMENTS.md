# Improvements for Rockman

1. **Separate game logic from rendering:**
   Create separate functions for updating game state and rendering. This will improve code organization and make it easier to maintain.

2. **Implement collision detection:**
   Add logic to detect collisions between Rockman and falling rocks, ending the game when a collision occurs.

3. **Add a game over screen:**
   Display a game over screen with the final score and time when the player loses.

4. **Implement difficulty progression:**
   Gradually increase the game's difficulty by increasing rock fall speed or spawn rate over time.

5. **Add a scoring system:**
   Implement a scoring system based on survival time or rocks avoided.

6. **Create a config file:**
   Move game constants (e.g., screen dimensions, rock spawn rate) to a separate configuration file for easy tweaking.

7. **Implement power-ups:**
   Add occasional power-ups that provide temporary benefits (e.g., invincibility, slower rocks).

8. **Optimize rock management:**
   Use a more efficient data structure (e.g., spatial partitioning) for managing rocks, especially as their number increases.

9. **Add sound effects:**
   Implement basic sound effects for actions like moving Rockman or rocks falling.

10. **Implement a high score system:**
    Save and display high scores between game sessions.

11. **Add input validation:**
    Ensure all user inputs are properly validated to prevent unexpected behavior.

12. **Implement proper game state management:**
    Create different game states (e.g., menu, playing, game over) for better flow control.

13. **Add comments and docstrings:**
    Improve code documentation with more detailed comments and function docstrings.

14. **Implement unit tests:**
    Add unit tests for core game logic to ensure reliability and ease future modifications.

15. **Use type hints:**
    Add type hints to function parameters and return values for better code clarity and potential bug catching.
