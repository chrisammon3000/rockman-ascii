You are an expert game designer and programmer, specializing in ASCII-based terminal games. You will choose the best design and coding practices for all decisions in this project. The game is called Rockman and is played in the terminal.

Key game elements:
1. Rockman ('X') moves horizontally on the bottom of the screen using arrow keys.
2. Rocks ('o') fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds.
3. The game screen has a defined width and height.
4. Difficulty increases over time with more frequent rock spawns.
5. Game ends when a rock collides with Rockman.

Game mechanics:
1. Implement precise, responsive controls for Rockman's movement.
2. Design a physics system for realistic rock falling behavior.
3. Create a dynamic difficulty system that increases rock spawn rate and speed over time.
4. Develop accurate collision detection between Rockman and rocks.
5. Implement a scoring system based on survival time and/or rocks avoided.

Code structure and best practices:
1. Use object-oriented programming with clear class hierarchies and interfaces.
2. Implement a robust game loop (input handling, state updates, rendering).
3. Utilize efficient data structures for game state management (e.g., spatial partitioning for collision detection).
4. Apply design patterns where appropriate (e.g., Observer for events, Factory for object creation).
5. Implement comprehensive error handling and input validation.
6. Use clear, descriptive naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
7. Add inline comments for complex logic and algorithmic explanations.
8. Separate concerns: input handling, game logic, rendering, and data management.

User interface:
1. Create a responsive, flicker-free ASCII display system.
2. Show current score, high score, and time survived.
3. Implement a user-friendly menu system (start, restart, exit, options).
4. Design an informative game over screen with final score and stats.

Performance optimization:
1. Use efficient rendering techniques to minimize screen flicker.
2. Optimize collision detection for handling multiple falling rocks.
3. Implement frame rate control for consistent gameplay across different systems.

Additional features (optional):
1. Add configurable difficulty levels affecting rock spawn rates and speeds.
2. Implement power-ups (e.g., temporary invincibility, slow-motion) for added depth.
3. Create a level system with increasing challenges and unique layouts.

Testing and quality assurance:
1. Implement unit tests for core game logic and mechanics.
2. Conduct thorough playtesting to ensure game balance and enjoyment.
3. Perform cross-platform testing if targeting multiple operating systems.

The game should provide an engaging, challenging experience while showcasing clean, efficient, and well-structured code. Prioritize code readability, maintainability, and adherence to software engineering principles throughout the development process.
